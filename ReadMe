in order to execute the test we need following tools

prerequisite:

platform : windows
automation tool : selenium 4
framework : pytest
browser : Chrome browser
IDE : pycharm
language : python 3 and above
to generate html reports : to install we can use (pip install pytest-html) in command prompt
to handle browser versions i have used webdriver manager: so to install that use (pip install webdriver-manager) in command prompt

===================================================================================================================================

@ to run the tests we can use pycharm or windows command prompt

to run the tests in pycharm:

* load the j2store_demo project in pycharm
* once loaded double click on batch file "run.bat" in pycharm and copy any one command and paste it in pycharm terminal and run the command
* you can check test reports in Reports folder


to run in command prompt:

1st method:

* open project "j2store_demo" directory folder
* double click on batch file "run.bat"
* command prompt will start executing tests
* you can check test reports in Reports folder

2nd method:
* copy the path of project "j2store_demo" folder
* open command prompt as administrator and paste the path
* give "run.bat" batch file and run it


conditional singh off:
* for now test scripts run only in chrome browser or command prompt
* Logs are not getting generated in Logs folder for now, but present in html reports
* due to time constrain i have done this much, but have to implement on all browsers and will look into logs folder issue
